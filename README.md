## What is this project about?
 When I was working as a Senior System Engineer/Architect, I developed a web-based/standalone system/application monitoring tool and knowledge base for on-call or field system engineers.
The problem is that sometimes you have to work without an internet connection. Still, the task is configuring or setting up some systems or applications in the data center or cloud environment. Sometimes, you must troubleshoot complicated systems, resolve incidents, or provide root cause analysis. In this case, it will be beneficial to have all system information in one place and keep it with you on-site and on time when it would be required.
As the answer to those challenges and based on day-to-day practice, I have developed this system. The system was developed on Apache Web Server, Linux, CGI, PHP, JavaScript, RPC, *shell, and C and applied for the Distributed Datacentreâ€™s based clustered HA&DR infrastructure. I have used a booted from the external media notebook and/or dedicated server in case of centralized usage.
I want to share my experience and thoughts, especially considering that some of the architectural solutions used have grown to IaaS and IaC concepts and as AWS SnowBall/AWS Snowball Edge solutions for the Cloud. I also found that the approaches used fit well with TOGAF and ADM methodologies regarding infrastructure. I think this experience and lesson learned may be helpful today, too.
